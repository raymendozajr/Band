Jane

Jane why don't you take me back
Jane why don't you take me back

No, no, she said no
No, no, she said no

Jane you know you're makin' me sick
Jane you know you're makin' me sick
Jane why don't you get rid of it
Jane you know you're makin' me sick of it

No, no, she said no
No, no, she said no

[solo]

[verse 3]
Jane won't you let me go
Jane won't you let me go
Jane won't you let me go
Jane won't you let me go
No, no, she said no
No, no, she said no
No, no, she said no
No, no, she said no
