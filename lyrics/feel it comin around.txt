[intro]
hey baby, there's something I've been meaning to tell you.
but y'know, it's kinda hard for me to say
cuz y'know I'm not one for words
so I'll sing it to you instead, it goes like this

[verse 1]
I said now babe, you've gone and kicked me out I said
where'm I gonna go, baby
I said now babe, don't go 'n scream and shout, I said
do do do, do do do, baby, do do do, do do do

I said don't waste, you're gonna waste my time
If you not comin' around baby
I said now change, you gotta change yo' mind, and I said
do do do, do do do, baby, do do do, do do do

[verse 2]
I said don't break, you're gonna break me down I said
I've got no time for this baby,
I said now stop, you're gonna freak me out, and I said
do do do, do do do, baby, do do do, do do do

You stop foolin' around baby, you stop foolin' ye-yah
you stop foolin' baby
I said now freak, you're gonna freak me out I said
do do do, do do do, baby, do do do, do do do

[chorus]
you have got it comin' now baby, you've got to stop this now
you have got me tripping now baby, you've got to take me out
you gone and flip flop, comin' around you flip flop comin' around, you tip top goin' around baby

[jam / key solo (sax solo)]

"bridge"

[bridge]
goin' down comin' around baby, I said, I said, you know 

you won't stop foolin' around

you know you won't stop foolin' around
you know you can't stop foolin' around
you know you can't stop foolin' around
you know you can't stop foolin' around

(harmonized)
you know you can't stop foolin' around
you know you can't stop foolin' around
you know you can't stop foolin' around
you know you can't stop foolin' around
